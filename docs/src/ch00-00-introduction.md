# Introduction

PolyQL is a modern and lightweight GraphQL Client. It's a lot simpler than [relay][relay] and [apollo][apollo] and yet powerful enough to power medium sized projects. Due to it's simplicity you can easily implement your own set of features needed for your specific usecase.

#### Lightweight

With less than 7kb bundle size PolyQL is a perfect fit for smaller apps.

#### Extendable

Easily extendable so you can make it work for your usecase. Well documented [API](./ch04-00-api-reference.md) built with plugins in mind.

#### Modern

Really simple modern promise based API - built for `async` / `await`.
