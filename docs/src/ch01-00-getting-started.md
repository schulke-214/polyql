# Getting Started

## Requirements

Since the examples are almost only written in ES7+ it's recommended to setup a small development environment to follow along ([parcel][parcel] is really good for that). Therefore you should have a recent `node` version installed and have access to `npm`/`yarn` to install dependencies if needed.

> **Warning:**
>
> This library is very unstable at the moment. It's suggested to only play around with it until it's stable `^1.0.0`.
