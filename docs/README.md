## Installation

:::warning
This library is very unstable at the moment. I'd suggest only playing around with it until it's stable (v1.0.0 upwards).
:::

```
yarn add polyql
```

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/polyql@latest/lib/polyql.umd.js" />
```

:::tip
If you include the umd module the `polyql` variable will be available on the window object.
