## Credits

The primary inspiration to build this library came from [graphql-request](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request) and [lokka](https://github.com/kadirahq/lokka). The only reason i built a client myself was that i really missed the out-of-the-box support for queries via `GET` / QueryString. No simple client were able to support that, without me configuring alot of stuff.
